Rules For Loops
1. Use a while-loop only to loop forever, and that means probably never. 
This only applies to Python, other languages are different.

2. Use a for-loop for all other kinds of looping, 
especially if there is a fixed or limited number of things to loop over.


Tips For Debugging

1. Do not use a “debugger”. A debugger is like doing a full-body scan 
on a sick person. You do not get any specific useful information, 
and you find a whole lot of information that doesn’t help and is just confusing.

2. The best way to debug a program is to use print to print out the values of variables at points in the program to see where they go wrong.

3. Make sure parts of your programs work as you work on them. 
Do not write massive files of code before you try to run them. 
Code a little, run a little, fix a little.
