# OOP & OOD from A to Z 

  **YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO**:
    
    --*Have a definition of the idea/concept w/o examples
    --*Have a couple examples you have rehearsed and can explain and code on the fly 
  
  ### 1. **The Basic terms:**
  
     a.Class: Base class, Subclass , superclass, abstract
     
    - Know thy differences
      
      b. inheritance
      
        i) is a, explain it
        
        ii) Can an object inherit only from 
          one class from a specific hierarchial level. 
            yes? No? When? Drawbacks? 
      
      c. class has...
        i) instance variables (things a class knows about)
        ii) methods (things a class does)
      
      d.Polymorphism (v. overriding or overloading)
      
      e.Composition/aggregation
        i) has a, explain it
        ii)Can an object be composed of multiple things?
      
      f.Multiple inheritance
      
      g.Encapsulation
        i) Why do you need it?
      
      h.Interface ( aka  protocol)
        i) Know the difference between interface and abstract class
      (skipping i due to confusion)
      
      j.Reiterating method stuff (seriously, learn it):
        i.METHOD...
           a.overriding
           b.overloading (vs. overriding)
          
           c.signatures (What is included in one)
           d.visibility (e.g. public, private, protected, etc.)
      
      k.Objects briefly explained
      
        i) An object is a specific instance of a class
          ex) 
            *class: Mammal
              **subclass: 
                ***Zebra  inherits from mammal
                ***instance variables: number of legs 
                ****methods: running (from movement)
                    **instantiate the class zebra and create Tom
                    **Tom: 
                    *****instance variable: Tom has 4 legs
                    *****method: Tom runs at 20 MPH
     
     l. Singleton
     m. Initalizer

  ### 2.Object oriented Design (OOD):
    
    a.For the OO design weeder question, have them describe:
       -What classes they would define.
       -What methods go in each class (including signatures).
       -What the class constructors are responsible for.
       -What data structures the class will have to maintain.
       -Whether any Design Patterns are applicable to this problem
    
    b. Some examples (thanks Steve Yegge):
    
      i)Model the Animal kingdom as a class system
      
      ii)Find some online and try to build the design from scratch
    
    c.OOD Concepts:
    
      -KNOW EACH ONE DOWN COLD: Define it, have examples, and why/when to use OOD vs. other 
      
      -paradigms (the last goal is a rather advanced thing, don't worry too much)
      
      i)Robustness
      
      ii)Adaptability
      
      iii)Reusability
    
    d. Object oriented design principles (OODP):
    
      i)Modularity
      
      ii)Abstraction
      
      iii)Encapsulation
