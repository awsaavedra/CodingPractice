# OOP & OOD from A to Z 

  **YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO**:
    
    --*Have a definition of the idea/concept w/o examples
    --*Have a couple examples you have rehearsed and can explain and code on the fly 
  
  1. **The Basic terms:**
  
    a.**Class**: Base class, Subclass , superclass, abstract.
      
    b.**inheritance**
      -is a, explain it
      
    c. **class** has...
      -instance variables (things a class knows about)
      -methods (things a class does)
      
    d.**Polymorphism** (v. overriding or overloading)
      
    e.**Composition/aggregation**
      -has a, explain it
      -Can an object be composed of multiple things? What about mult inheritance?
      
    f. **Multiple inheritance** and which languages have it
      
    g. **Encapsulation**
      i) Why do you need it?
      
    h. **Interface** ( aka  protocol)
      i) Know the difference between interface and abstract class
      
    j.Reiterating method stuff (seriously, learn it):
      i.**METHOD**...
           a.**overriding**
           b.**overloading**(vs. overriding)
          
           c.**signatures (What is included in one)
           d.visibility (e.g. public, private, protected, etc.)
      
      k.Objects briefly explained
      
        i) An object is a specific instance of a class
          ex) 
            *class: Mammal
              **subclass: 
                ***Zebra  inherits from mammal
                ***instance variables: number of legs 
                ****methods: running (from movement)
                    **instantiate the class zebra and create Tom
                    **Tom: 
                    *****instance variable: Tom has 4 legs
                    *****method: Tom runs at 20 MPH
     
     l. Singleton
     m. Initalizer

  2. **Object oriented Design (OOD)**:
    
    a.For the OO design weeder question, have them describe:
       -What classes they would define.
       -What methods go in each class (including signatures).
       -What the class constructors are responsible for.
       -What data structures the class will have to maintain.
       -Whether any Design Patterns are applicable to this problem
    
    b. Some examples (thanks Steve Yegge):
    
      i)Model the Animal kingdom as a class system
      
      ii)Find some online and try to build the design from scratch
    
    c.OOD Concepts:
    
      -KNOW EACH ONE DOWN COLD: Define it, have examples, and why/when to use OOD vs. other 
      
      -paradigms (the last goal is a rather advanced thing, don't worry too much)
      
      i)Robustness
      
      ii)Adaptability
      
      iii)Reusability
    
    d. Object oriented design principles (OODP):
    
      i)Modularity
      
      ii)Abstraction
      
      iii)Encapsulation
