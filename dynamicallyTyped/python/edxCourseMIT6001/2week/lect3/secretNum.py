'''
The program works as follows: you (the user) thinks of an integer between 0 
(inclusive) and 100 (not inclusive). The computer makes guesses, and you 
give it input - is its guess too high or too low? Using bisection search, 
the computer will guess the user's secret number!
'''
print "Please think of a number between 0 and 100!"

raw_input("Enter 'h' to indicate the guess is too high. Enter 'l' to indicate the guess is too low. Enter 'c' to indicate I guessed correctly.")
