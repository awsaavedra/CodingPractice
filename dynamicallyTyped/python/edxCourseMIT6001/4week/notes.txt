terms to know:
	path complete (glassbox testing)
	paths through specifications
	unit testing
	integration testing
	driver- piece of code that does the testing for us
	stub- "if this code was there, this is what it should do"
	over vs. covert bug
	intermittent vs persistant bug	
	exceptions--indexOutOfBounds, etc.

workflow:
	unit testing --> integration testing --> regression testing
