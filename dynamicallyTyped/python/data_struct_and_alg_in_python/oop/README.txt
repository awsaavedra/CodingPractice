OOP from A to Z (See subdir for examples)
  YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO: 
    **Have a definition of the idea/concept w/o examples
    **Have a couple examples you have rehearsed and can explain and code on the fly 
    **
  1. The Basic terms:
      a. Class: Base class, Subclass (derived class), superclass, abstract class
        i) Know thy differences
      b. inheritance
        i) is-a, explain it
        ii) Can an object inherit only from one class from a specific hierarchial level?
          --yes? No? When? Drawbacks? 
      c. class has...
        i) instance variables - things a class knows about 
        ii) methods - things a class does
      d.Polymorphism
      e.Composition/aggregation
        i) has-a, explain it
        ii)Can an object be composed of multiple things?
      f.Multiple inheritance
      g.Encapsulation
        i) Why do you need it?
      h.Interface ( aka  protocol)
        i) Know the difference between interface and abstract class
      (skipping i due to confusion)
      j.Reiterating method stuff (seriously, learn it):
        METHOD...
          --overriding
          --overloading (vs. overriding)
          
          --signatures (What is included in one)
          --visibility (e.g. public, private, protected, etc.)
      k.Objects briefly explained
        i) An object is a specific instance of a class
          ex) 
            class: Mammal
              subclass: 
                Zebra- inherits from mammal
                  -instance variables: number of legs (I could write more I guess)
                  -methods: running (from movement)
                    **instantiate the class zebra and create Tom
                      Tom: 
     i                   -instance variable: Tom has 4 legs
                        -method: Tom runs at 20 MPH
  2.Object oriented Design (OOD):
    a.For the OO-design weeder question, have them describe:
      -What classes they would define.
      -What methods go in each class (including signatures).
      -What the class constructors are responsible for.
      -What data structures the class will have to maintain.
      -Whether any Design Patterns are applicable to this problem
    b. Some examples (thanks Steve Yegge):
      i)Model the Animal kingdom as a class system, for use in a Virtual Zoo program
      ii)Find some online and try to built the design without peeking at code
    c.OOD Concepts:
      **KNOW EACH ONE DOWN COLD: Define it, have examples, and why/when to use OOD vs. other 
        paradigms (the last goal is a rather advanced thing, don't worry too much)
      i)Robustness
      ii)Adaptability
      iii)Reusability
    d. Object oriented design principles (OODP):
      i)Modularity
      ii)Abstraction
      iii)Encapsulation (I know I said this one already, but knowing where it fits is important)
