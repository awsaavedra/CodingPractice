/*
	The primary thing to know about linked lists is that they are 
	great for inserting anywhere, as opposed to arrays which are good for insertion
	at the end of the array (think push method)

	pros:
		fast insertion 
	cons:
		not contiguous in memory so traversal is necessary when searching O(n),
		aka no random access
