# Extra Credit
# 1. In Terminal where you normally run python to run your scripts, type: pydoc raw_input.
# Read what it says.
# 2. Get out of pydoc by typing q to quit.
# 3. Go look online for what the pydoc command does.
# 4. Use pydoc to also read about open, file, os, and sys. Itâ€™s alright if you do not understand
# those, just read through and take notes about interesting things.
