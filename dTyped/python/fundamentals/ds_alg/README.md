#Data Structures and Algorithms

    Just remember this: 
    
    A programming language is merely a vehicle for implementing
    things that do exactly what you want when you do code them right. 
    Everything in programming reduces to abstract models
    that are fundamentally blue prints for this. 

    My reason for choosing python for teaching programming is because 
    it is an abstract enough 
    language that you will not get as easily discouraged, 
    powerful enough that we can do get what
    we want done, and supports both OOP and FP paradigms.
