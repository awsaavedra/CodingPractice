#Data Structures and Algorithms

    Just a bit of philosophy: 
    
    A programming language is merely a vehicle for implementing
    things that __could__ do exactly what you want when you do code them. 

    My reasons for choosing python is because 
    it is an abstract enough language that you will not get as easily discouraged, 
    powerful enough that we can get what we want done, 
    and supports both OOP and FP paradigms.

    The obvious is only obvious now. 
    As you zoom into something the lack of understanding grows clearer. 
    Take comfort in the fact that no one fully knows anything, but 
    don't let that stop you from working your ass off to understand anything and 
    everything that you find interesting. This is just one area to sharpen 
    your way of thinking. Just like math, this is not naturally easy for most,
    but it can be incredibly rewarding within itself.

    I was once told "oh, so you program for a living?" No. I program because it 
    is something I enjoy, if I grow tired of it I will switch careers, but it 
    is a part of me now. Once you do something for a long time and throw yourself
    into it with lots of passion it will become part of you. If you start
    on this journey and don't like it that's fine, but don't get discouraged and 
    convince yourself you didn't try because it is hard.

    Almost everything that's worthwhile is hard: maintaining a friendship for decades,
    telling the one you used to love you don't love them anymore,
    swallowing your pride and admitting your mistakes are all hard. It has become
    clear to me that you are tormented more in the end because of what if's than
    failures.
